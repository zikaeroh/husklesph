    -   Set `ph_auto_taunt_delay_min` and `ph_auto_taunt_delay_max` to control the frequency of auto taunts in seconds. If a player doesn't taunt (within a randomly selected time between those two values), they will be forced to taunt. The default range is `[60, 120]`.
    -   Set `ph_auto_taunt_props_only 0` to enable auto taunts for hunters. The default is to only auto taunt for props.

## v1.4.0
