# Prop Hunters - Huskles Edition

This is a fork of [MechanicalMind's Prop Hunters](https://github.com/MechanicalMind/prophunters),
intended to fix a few bugs and add a few features.

A full changelog can be found in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

## Improvements

For the full list, take a look at the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md), but here is a non-exhaustive list:

-   On death, taunts no longer persist into spectator mode.
-   The taunt menu remembers your mouse position when reopened.
-   Auto taunts are natively supported!
-   The `ph_endround` command forces a round to end on a tie.
-   Taunts can be restricted to a specific player model. See the taunt docs for more info.
-   All (useful) commands and convars have ULX commands; this is not yet in this repo but comes in the Steam workshop item.
-   Large props can properly re-disguise.
-   Spawn points are generated automatically from existing spawn points, leading to much greater success in spawning players when the map doesn't provide enough.
